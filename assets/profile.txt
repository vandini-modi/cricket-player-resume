Cricket has been my passion since the age of 9, shaping not just my skills but my mindset. As a disciplined right-arm bowler, I bring consistency, adaptability, and sharp tactical awareness to every match. Known for performing under pressure and adjusting to varying pitch conditions, I aim to contribute match-winning performances and add strategic value to any team I represent.
